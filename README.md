### Gecko tests EFM32PG22

For some unknown reason I've choosed this board for a project and I'm starting to learn it in a daily basis. I like Silabs is a good IC maker and I'm too accostumed to Espressif framework and Arduino.
We've choose the hard path to make something out of our comfort zone and this is my personal playground.

Things I will be testing for the project:

- ADC test just to read the battery Voltage
- 24 pin SPI epaper
- MOSFET N-Channel to connect ground to an external Device
- 4G Modem
- RFID

All this things may land here unordered, with half working tests, that are part of my learning process.
Avoid using any part of this mess for anything that will be real Firmware.
